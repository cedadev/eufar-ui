Getting Your Results
--------------------

### Export Results

This dialogue box will help you export any search hits you may have for a
given area. It will allow you to export the data in 3 given formats:

* **Raw Elasticsearch JSON documents**. This is generally intended for software
  developers or people who can directly interact with the Elasticsearch
  installation. This does include an amount of useful raw metadata, but
  generally it's not as useful as the other options.
* **File Paths**. This will export a JSON list of BADC system file paths. This is
  useful if you have filesystem access to the EUFAR archive - e.g. on JASMIN
  or through another entry point.
* **Download URLs**. This is probably the most useful option to you. This will
  provide a JSON list of URLs which can be directly used to download any
  matching data files.
