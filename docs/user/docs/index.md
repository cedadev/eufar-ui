EUFAR Flight Finder Help Pages
==============================

The Interface
-------------

The screen in front of you should be split into two sections. On the left
should be a side panel with accordion-style expanding elements that contain
useful elements for refining your search parameters. On the right should be a
large map with coloured flight tracks overlaid on top.

These flight tracks are simple 30-coordinate tracks extracted from flight data
contained within the EUFAR archive. They should give a fairly good overview of
where a particular flight went - but they may not be totally accurate as they
are only short summaries, and the track resolution is not very high. This is
done on purpose as it makes the user interface faster!

You can pan around the map by clicking and dragging on the map. The map's
bounding box will automatically change, and the interface will automatically
search for and display flights within the area. You can also zoom in and out
using the controls in the top-left of the map. The map is from Google Maps, so
the interface should be familiar if you have used that before.


Looking at Your Results
-----------------------

Each flight track is clickable and will bring up an information dialogue when
selected. This will provide some basic information about each individual file
including a link to the BADC archive to download the data, the recorded start
and end time for the data, the file name, the organisation ID and flight
number.
