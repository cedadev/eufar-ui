Troubleshooting
===============

Why aren't there many results?
------------------------------

To keep the search interface lightweight and fast, only the first few hundred
results are drawn on the screen. There may be more hits in a given area, but
they may not be drawn by the interface - this is to improve performance and
keep the searches working in real-time.


Why are the flight tracks all different colours?
------------------------------------------------

This is just to help you tell one flight track from another - each one is
given a unique colour so that you can tell which one is which if there are
several within a small area.
