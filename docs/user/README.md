Generating Docs
===============

Install [mkdocs](https://github.com/tomchristie/mkdocs) and run the following
command to generate documentation for this project:

```
pip install mkdocs==0.10.0   # Do not install newer version
mkdocs build
```

The documentation will be generated and put in a folder called "site" for
browsing at any time. However, the easiest way to browse this documentation is
to issue the following command:

```
mkdocs serve
```

Once this is done, open [this link](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to browse
documentation.
